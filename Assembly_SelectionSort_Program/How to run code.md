# A sorting algorithm written in assembly

# To run the program, follow and write the following commands in the command prompt/terminal:

  1. Navigate to the correct folder in the command prompt/terminal etc...
  2. Write "Make" on the command line to compile the program
  3. write "./program 10". The number behind "./program" can be edited and will represent the number of items that will be sorted.
  4. The printed number will represent the time it took to run the program in microseconds.  
  5. To test the C-implementation, comment out line 96 and uncomment line 97 in the "main" file
